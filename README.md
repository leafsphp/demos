<h1 align="center">Leaf Project Showcase</h1>

This repo contains real-world based applications built with Leaf. Projects are grouped into `leaf`, `leaf api`, `leaf mvc` and `skeleton`, as these are scaffolds offered by the Leaf CLI. These projects are meant to be used as a starting point for your own projects or as a reference for learning on your Leaf journey.

*Note that most of these projects will not be hosted online, but will include all necessary steps to get them running successfully. These projects will also be kept up to date. You can always open a PR in case you notice some outdated dependencies.*

All projects listed here are open source and licensed under the MIT license. You can find the license file in the root of each project. If you have any questions, feel free to open an issue in this repo. If you want to add your own project, please open a PR. If you want to add a project that is not open source, please open an issue and we will discuss it.

All projects are listed in alphabetical order. Every project listed here can be found on the [Leaf showcase page](https://leafphp.dev/ecosystem/showcase).
